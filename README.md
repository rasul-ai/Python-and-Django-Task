# Python-and-Django-Task

When developing this Django project, I have used a Python virtual environment. This helps me in maintaining consistency and prevents potential conflicts between different projects. Here's how I have set up and activate a virtual environment for my Django project:
    1. Install Virtualenv: I have installed the virtualenv via pip:
       pip install virtualenv
    2. Create a Virtual Environment: In my project directory in the terminal and I have run the following command to create a virtual environment named env:
       virtualenv env
    3. Activate the Virtual Environment: As I used Ubuntu 22.04 operating system, the activation command in this case is :
       source env/bin/activate
    4. Install Django and Other Dependencies: While the virtual environment is active, I have installed Django and other dependencies for my project using pip:
       pip install django
By using a virtual environment, It is ensured that my project dependencies are managed separately from other projects and from the system Python installation, providing a clean and isolated environment for your development work.
